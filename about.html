	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		Hello there! I'm Brandon, a passionate Web Developer with a keen interest in coding. In addition to my coding endeavors, I enjoy practicing martial arts, taking bike rides around town, and, of course, gaming on my computer and PlayStation.

		With 1 very packed year of experience in Web Development, I have worked on various projects, which can be found on my portfolio page. During this time, I have gained adept knowledge and  experience in various languages and frameworks, including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>JavaScript</li>
		<li>Java</li>
		<li>Bootstrap</li>
		<li>Spring</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Outside of work and coding, you will find me tending to my 2 children, beautifying my lawn, or simply relaxing on the couch.

		I firmly believe in setting goals, taking responsibility, and embracing self-acceptance. My aim is to create a comfortable life for my family and myself. If you're interested in collaborating or simply want to have a friendly chat, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto: bran.tyler.hall@gmail.com">bran.tyler.hall@gmail.com</a>.
